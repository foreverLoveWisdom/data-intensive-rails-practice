# Data-Intensive Rails Practice

This is a simple Rails API application designed to practice and demonstrate key concepts from the book _Designing Data-Intensive Applications_ by Martin Kleppmann. The focus is on building **reliable**, **scalable**, and **maintainable** systems, with an emphasis on API design, background processing, and data handling.

## Purpose

- To explore and implement concepts like **reliability**, **scalability**, and **maintainability** in a data-intensive context.
